In this project, we are going to create a streamlit app connected to the testnet enviroment - we are calling it My Block Chain Resume. The app will have multipurpose functinalities.

1 - It will allow job seeking candidates to upload their resume within the app. Which will be instantly avaible for employers to view. 

2 - Employers will have the ability to toggle through resumes submitted and select any to view. The app will (should) display the resume selected by the employer. 

The streamlit app will have a title header, an upload button with browsing feature, 
a dropdown button where the addresses of all the uploaded resumes.

How are we going to execute this? (For now)
Juan - Will be researching the st upload feature
Fatih - Will be researching the st view feature
